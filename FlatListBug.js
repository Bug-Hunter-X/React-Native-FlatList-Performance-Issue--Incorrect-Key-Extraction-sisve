In React Native, using a `FlatList` or `SectionList` with a large dataset can lead to performance issues.  If not implemented correctly, it can cause slow rendering, lag, or even crashes. One uncommon issue is improperly handling key extraction.  If the `keyExtractor` function isn't correctly identifying unique keys for each item, React Native might struggle to update the list efficiently, leading to unexpected behavior and performance degradation.  Incorrect key generation can result in unnecessary re-renders and memory leaks.
